### TensorFlow Lite 

After reading further into 3D object detection research and projects I found most of the TensorFlow [research](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=tensorflow+3D+object+detection&hl=en&as_s) I have found is orientated around automatous driving trained by the [Kitt](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/kitti) dataset.  Which looks like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1f-s6_yHtw). 

 Two 3D object detection models which can be relatively easily converted to TFlite models are the [shoes](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/mediapipe/models/object_detection_3d_sneakers.tflite) and [chairs](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/mediapipe/models/object_detection_3d_chair.tflite) models mentioned in the last notebook entry.

Possibility's: 
- Use one or both of the shoes/chairs models  
- Try to train a model with data collected from ARcore as mentioned [here](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/real-time-3d-object-detection-on-mobile.html) under the "Obtaining Real-World 3D Training Data" section
