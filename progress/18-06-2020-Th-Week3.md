### ARcore Android

Notes:
- Class Object  is the root of the class hierarchy. 
Every class has Object as a superclass. All objects, including arrays, implement the methods of this class

Useful Classes:

- Pose

- Point
https://developers.google.com/ar/reference/java/arcore/reference/com/google/ar/core/Point

- Trackable
https://developers.google.com/ar/reference/java/arcore/reference/com/google/ar/core/Trackable

- Frame
https://developers.google.com/ar/reference/java/arcore/reference/com/google/ar/core/Frame

- Camera

Useful Functions:

*CameraIntrinsics.getImageDimensions()*
-  Returns a int[2] containing the image dimensions
- Might need to know dimentions of image befor feeding 
   them to nural network

*Camera.getProjectionMatrix(float[] dest, ...)*
-  Returns a projection matrix for rendering virtual 
   content on top of the camera image
- might be used to draw a bounding box around an object

*Frame.acquireCameraImage()*
-  Will be updated evey time update() is called
-  Attempts to acquire an image from the camera that 
   corresponds to the current frame
- This will be used to feed the nural net with the current image
 
*Point.createAnchor(Pose pose)*
-  Creates an anchor at the given pose in the world coordinate 
   space that is attached to this trackable
- Once TFlite returns the 3D coordinates of an object in an image
   an achor can be used to keep track of this position in space
- If anchors are used to keep track of objects in space, each object's
   achor points will only have to be found once, meaning that each
   objects coordinates will only have to be found once, I think.
   If the recalculation of coordinates might be necessary if multiple
   objects are tracked in space, but specifics can be figured out later

TODO:
- Figure out how to draw how to lines from point(anchors) of a Trackable(object in space)
